### Key Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates and missing values for better data integrity.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Examined the distributions of song features like danceability, energy, and tempo, and visualized genre popularity and correlations between features.

3. **Genre Popularity**: Analyzed the most and least popular genres based on song popularity.

4. **Modeling**: Built and evaluated classification models, such as Random Forest, to predict whether a song belongs to the "rock" genre based on its features.
